This is some rather basic information on the organizational structures of
a DVD. I collected this info over time from various sources, the most
valuable being an article in the German c't computer magazine.
Some of the info might be wrong according to the DVD standard (which I do
not know), but they are practically proven in libdvdnav.

1. physical structure - MPEG stream level
   - blocks, sectors
       * smallest addressable unit on disc
   - GOP (group of pictures)
       * contains multiple sectors
       * smallest self-contained MPEG unit
   - VOBU (video object unit)
       * contains multiple GOPs + audio and SPU blocks + NAV packet
       * smallest unit in seek and resume operations, always starts with a
         NAV packet used for menu button highlight and command information
         and to detect PTS discontinuities
   - ILVU (interleaved video unit)
       * contains multiple VOBUs (ususally only one)
       * blocking multiple VOBUs of multiple interleaved MPEG streams for
         multiangle features
   - VOB (video object)
       * contains multiple ILVUs (usually quite a lot)
       * one of the files on the disc
2. navigational structure - logical playback control
   - Cell
       * smallest unit which is layed out in sequence physically
       * points to a first and last VOBU
       * smallest unit to execute VM commands (cell_post commands)
       * smallest unit accesible by VM commands (apart from LinkRSM)
   - PG (program)
       * points to a Cell
       * usually the mapping between PG and Cells is 1:1, but not always
	 (multiple Cells inside one PG can occur when special VM commands
	 have to be executed in the middle of a PG, for example to switch
	 SPU channels or to provide a branching target for special
	 features that need access to parts of the movie)
       * unit for user skip operations
       * default unit for seeking
   - PGC (program chain)
       * contains multiple programs and cells
       * logical playback chain
       * VM commands at start and stop (PGC_pre and PGC_post commands)
       * might be used for seeking (see dvdnav_set_PGC_positioning())
3. title structure - high level navigation
   - PTT (part of title track)
       * points to a PG in a PGC
       * usually what you select in a "chapter menu" are parts
       * usually the mapping between PTT and PG is 1:1, but not always
   - TT (title track)
       * contains multiple PTTs
       * logical partitioning of the content
         (multiple episodes of a TV series on one DVD: one TT per episode)
   - VTS (video title set)
       * contains multiple TTs
       * high level partitioning of the content (movie / bonus material)
       * video, audio and spu attributes are common inside a whole VTS
4. domain structure - bringing it all together
   - FP (first play)
       * one special PGC in the VMGM domain run on start of the disc
   - VMGM (video manager menu) - files video_ts.{vob,ifo,bup}
       * the menu which allows you to select between title sets
       * contains a set of PGCs
   - VTSM (video title set menu) - files vts_<vtsN>_0.{vob,ifo,bup}
       * the menu which allows you to select between the TTs of a VTS
       * contains a set of PGCs
   - VTS (video title set) - files vts_<vtsN>_[1-9].vob, vts_<vtsN>_0.{ifo,bup}
       * regular playback
       * contains one VTS and a set of PGCs
