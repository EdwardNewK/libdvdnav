* Support DVDs with errors on them. So we can recover from corrupt sectors in the .VOB. Also, handle corrupt .IFO files by using the backup .BUP files.
* Support Random and Shuffle Titles. Only sequencial Titles are currently supported.
* Support Still PGCs. Only Still Cells are currently supported.
* Fix the Next_PGC = 0 problem with some DVDs. Not enought details on this yet.
* Properly implement seeking and position reporting (do not rely on sequential physical layout)
* DVDNAV_WAIT event that indicates to the application to wait for its fifos to run dry
  (prevents discrepancies between what the users sees on screen and what state libdvdnav is in)
