Reporting libdvdnav bugs:
-------------------------

Please file a bug in the debian Bug Tracking System only if it is a debian
specific bug, e.g. a packaging error. Usually I cannot fix myself bugs in
the library and I can only forward them to developer's mailinglist at
dvd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. Thank you.
